# Coffee-Time-Series-Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes global coffee export trends using Python to uncover seasonal demand cycles and generate short-term forecasts.
By leveraging statistical modeling and time-series forecasting, the analysis provides actionable insights into coffee export patterns across the world.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

Explore and visualize global coffee export data

Identify seasonal trends and patterns in export volumes

Apply time-series models to forecast short-term demand

Evaluate model performance and accuracy

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Statsmodels — for time series analysis and ARIMA modeling

Pandas — data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy — numerical computation

Matplotlib / Seaborn — data visualization

## 🔍 Methodology

Data Preparation

Collected and cleaned global coffee export data.

Transformed data into a time series format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized trends, seasonality, and patterns in export data.

Stationarity Testing

Conducted Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests to assess stationarity.

Seasonal Decomposition

Used additive/multiplicative decomposition to separate trend, seasonality, and residuals.

Forecasting Models

Applied ARIMA and AR models for forecasting.

Tuned model parameters and validated predictions with historical data.

Results & Insights

Identified distinct seasonal cycles in coffee export demand.

Produced reliable short-term forecasts for decision-making support.

## 📈 Results

Visualized seasonal export fluctuations.

Generated forecasts with low error margins.

Derived actionable insights for demand forecasting and retail planning.

## 🚀 Future Work

Incorporate exogenous factors (e.g., global prices, weather conditions).

Compare with machine learning models like Prophet, LSTM, or XGBoost.

Extend analysis to other commodities for cross-market insights.
